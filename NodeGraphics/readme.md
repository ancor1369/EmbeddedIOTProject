## The first characters!

And after the screen turned on by the first time, it is now possible to show characters. 
This code was successfully integrated and now it is possible to show characters as I want
on the screen. Thanks to arturlangnerbu the grate explanation in his post and the graphics library 
they created for E-Paper.
